The ELECTROCLEAN, the first product sold by the company, is the first appliance of its kind on the market and aims to develop a whole new category in the competitive home appliance landscape. As stated by a member of the third generation of the dynasty and the leading family member involved in launching the company “we want the ELECTROCLEAN to be an integral part of every household”.  Two years after its launch, the owners have decided to change the company’s management to accelerate growth and spur global expansion. Recognizing your leadership skills and expertise, you have been recruited to join this new management team.  The company operates in a competitive market alongside similar firms that have also utilized the same technology to develop equivalent products. At the start of your tenure, all companies in this emerging industry segment are in the same competitive position: 1) they sell an identical ELECTROCLEAN product with the same initial characteristics, 2) they have achieved comparable sales and market share in the regions where the product is available, and 3) they share similar production capabilities, financials, and company histories.    The decision-making process: the simulation context   As the new management team, you are responsible for making strategic, tactical, and operational decisions over the coming years of the company — unless you are dismissed due to poor performance, mismanagement, or lack of trust from the Board of Directors.

Your decisions must span all key functional areas: product design, marketing and sales, operations, 
logistics, finance, people, ESG1, etc. Importantly, these decisions must be aligned with a clear and 
adaptable company strategy. 
 
Time in the simulation is organized into Periods, each representing four months and composed of 8 
fortnights of 10 working days (also called Subperiods), totaling 80 working days per period. Each 
simulated year includes three periods, resulting in a full year of 240 working days (3 × 80). When 
you take over as management, you begin at Period 7, which corresponds to the start of Year 3 of 
operations. 
 
At the start of each period, you must input all your company decisions into the simulation platform. 
These decisions fall into two categories: 
1. Period-wide decisions — these remain fixed for the entire four-month period (e.g., product 
pricing, machinery purchases, long-term financing adjustments). 
2. Fortnight-specific decisions — these allow for finer control (e.g., product shipments, credit 
line changes) and must also be planned before the simulation run. 
 
Important: All decisions for the period — both strategic and operational — must be submitted together 
before the simulation run begins. 
 
Once decisions are submitted, the simulation runs and generates detailed performance reports 
covering market results, operational efficiency and financial outcomes. These reports reflect both 
your company’s decisions and those of your competitors. You will use these outputs to evaluate your 
strategy, identify mistakes or missed opportunities, and plan your actions for the next period. 
 
Details on the company’s current market situation, your functional responsibilities, and how to 
navigate the simulation platform are provided in the accompanying “Participant’s Guide”. 
What follows provides details on the company’s market and financial situation, as well as the 
functional responsibilities and decisions your team will need to address. Specific instructions on how 
to access the simulation, input decisions, and analyze reports can be found in the accompanying 
“Participant’s Guide”.  
 
Chapter I. Global market context 
 
Section I.a: Regions, Segments and Demand Forecasts 
 
Market Regions. Mezquite operates in a global market divided into 5 distinct regions: Center, West, 
North, East and South. Each region functions independently, with unique market demands and 
customer behaviors specific to that region. 
 
Customers Segments. Each region varies in population size and demographics. However, since 
Electroclean represents a new product category, information on customers segment preferences and 
behavior remains relatively scarce. 
 
 
1 The term ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) refers to a series of criteria used to assess a company’s 
performance and commitment in these areas. At Mezquite, certain decisions directly influence these criteria.

Your marketing department has decided to divide the market into two primary sociodemographic 
segments:  
 
 High-end: This segment consists of individuals and families with medium-to-high incomes, 
representing a smaller share of the population in each market. While evidence is not conclusive, 
this group is expected to be less price-sensitive and place greater value on product performance, 
advanced functionalities, and design. 
 
 Low-end: This segment includes individuals with mid-to-low incomes (those with very low 
incomes are not considered a target for the new appliance). It constitutes a larger portion of the 
population in most markets. While generally more price-sensitive, their attitudes toward the 
product are not yet fully understood. They are expected to prioritize performance and efficiency 
but may also show interest in additional functionalities due to the novelty of the appliance. 
 
Population and aggregated demand. The product has been introduced in the Central, West and 
North regions over the past two years, achieving significant growth and market penetration. The East 
and South regions remain untapped markets.   
 
The estimated average household population per company for each segment and region is provided 
in Table I. 1. The average demand per company (in units) observed during Periods 1 to 6 in the 
markets where Mezquite is present is available in Table I. 2.  
 
The simulation uses population and market demand data on a per-company basis, allowing it to scale 
dynamically with the number of companies. To determine the total population size and total demand 
for each market, the average values from the tables must be multiplied by the number of companies 
operating in that market.

Low 74,800 51,000 50,400 40,000 20,400 
(*) Target populations assume that, over the long term, Electrocleans could achieve a stable 22% to 
25% penetration over the total households in the markets where it is being sold.

Historical sales data indicate some seasonality, with higher growth observed during the holiday 
season in the last period of each year (Periods 3 and 6). 
 
Future growth forecasts, however, lack industry consensus. Existing markets are expected to see 
continued product penetration, though growth rates may slow or stagnate as penetration matures. The

East and South markets are anticipated to follow a similar trajectory but with significant uncertainty. 
These markets could develop more rapidly due to the faster spread of information across regions. 
Table I. 3 shows the expected annual demand per region in year 3 (comprising Periods 7, 8, and 9) 
according to aggregated studies. 
 
 
Table I. 3 Expected demand per company in Year 3 (in units) 
Region Expected Demand in Year 3 
East 3,000 to 5,000 
South 2,500 to 3,500 
 
 
Total demand, however, is subject to multiple factors influenced by aggregated company decisions, 
including average market prices, total advertising expenditure, product appeal, and other variables. It 
is the responsibility of the Marketing and Sales department to account for these uncertainties when 
developing the company's forecasts. 
 
 
Section I.b: Competitors Position  
 
Competitors. The number of companies competing in each region may vary across simulations 
(hence the need to use average demand per company).  
 
At the beginning of Period 7, all competitors (including your company) offer the same entry-level 
product in the Central, West, and North regions. Consequently, all competitors initially hold equal 
market shares in these regions. For example, with five companies in the simulation, each would 
control 20% of the market in each of these regions at the beginning of Period 7. 
 
In the East and South regions, where no product has yet been introduced, the competitive landscape 
is open. Market shares in these regions will depend on the sales generated by each company’s 
decisions during the period. In the extreme scenario where only one company enters a new market, 
that company would capture 100% of the market share for that period 
 
The product and marketing decisions that your company makes in each region, compared to those of 
your competitors, will determine the potential demand you can meet in each region (and consequently, 
your potential sales and market share). Since each market operates independently, companies can 
adopt distinct strategies for different regions. For example, a company might lead the market in the 
Central region but hold minimal market share in the Western or Northern regions. 
 
As markets evolve and mature, market shares are unlikely to shift dramatically from one period to the 
next due to consumer inertia. This should be factored into your strategy when positioning your 
company in each market. Gaining significant market share in a region where competitors are already 
well-established may require sustained commercial effort over multiple periods. 
--- Page 5 (pypdf) ---
IESE / IPADE  October 2025 review

However, abrupt changes in market share can occur due to competitors' risky strategies or operational 
failures. For instance: 
 Pricing Missteps: Consumers have limits on their disposable income for appliances like 
Electroclean. Excessively high prices or abrupt price changes can lead to sudden sales drops and 
market share losses. 
 Operational Failures: A company may be unable to fulfill the potential demand generated by 
its commercial strategies due to poor operational planning, production issues, or inaccurate 
forecasting. This results in lost sales and an actual reduced market share. In extreme cases, it 
could even lead to the company being effectively pushed out of the market. 
 
 
Section I.c: Channels and Sales 
 
The primary distribution channel for Mezquite products consists of regional distributors. These 
distributors are Mezquite’s direct customers and are responsible for supplying products to various 
retailers through their proprietary networks of warehouses and transportation. Importantly, each 
distributor operates exclusively within its assigned region, meaning distributors in one region are 
entirely independent of those in other regions. 
 
As the simulation progresses, additional sales channels may become available. These could include 
direct sales to large retail chains, partnerships with online merchants (e.g., Amazon), or developing 
your own e-commerce platform. However, the availability of these channels depends on the 
simulation’s context and decisions made by the instructors. More details on the specifc decisions 
needed to manage the distributior channel are given in Section III.c (Channel Commercial Effort). 
 
The total demand generated by your company in a period is evenly divided across the 4 months. This 
demand is allocated to the end of each month, corresponding to the even fortnights (fortnights 2, 4, 
6, and 8). If you fail to meet the requested demand in any of the even fortnights, the unmet demand 
in this month is lost and is considered a lost sale2. This process is independently verified in each of 
the five market regions. To minimize lost sales, it is essential to plan and distribute your production 
of Electrocleans to regional warehouses efficiently to meet demand on schedule. 
 
 
Chapter II. Innovation 
Mezquite currently commercializes a single product under a unique brand. Due to the early stage of 
innovation and budgetary restrictions, the product offered in the market has limited features. 
However, the Innovation department has been collaborating with marketing to define a range of 
possible improvement features aimed at making the product more appealing to different market 
segments.  
 
As part of the innovation strategy, the company must decide which improvements are more relevant, 
considering that these enhancements impact key customer preferences, such as design/aesthetics, 
performance, and convenience. Different segments prioritize these dimensions differently, and these 
preferences may evolve over time.  
 
The Innovation department has evaluated the proposed features and estimated the upfront 
development investment required to integrate each feature into a new Electroclean design. They have

own demand in the following periods.

also estimated the extra variable cost per unit produced for each improvement, accounting for 
increased labor and additional components. Notably, the improved features are incorporated into the 
product during a just-in-sale postponement process at the company warehouses, right before the 
product is shipped to distributors. This approach reduces production and logistics complexity by 
maintaining only the basic product configuration in inventory. The improvements are applied at the 
final stage, eliminating the need to produce, manage, and track different product variants throughout 
the simulation. This strategy streamlines operations while offering flexibility in meeting customer 
demands. 
 
Table II. 1 provides a preliminary list of product features, along with their estimated upfront 
development costs and extra variable production costs. The costs are additive, meaning that the total 
investment and variable costs for incorporating multiple features are the sum of the individual costs 
of those features. 
 
The development costs are paid upfront at the beginning of the four-month period when the decision 
to introduce the feature is made. The company accounting policy is to record these development costs 
as intangible assets in the balance sheet and amortize them over the course of 3 periods.  
 
The extra variable costs are incurred (and paid) at the time of sales (i.e., in the even fortnights). These 
costs are calculated as the units sold multiplied by the extra unit cost. In the accounting records, they 
are reflected in the P&L as an extra variable production cost item line (refer to Section VI for more 
details). 
 
Once an improvement is chosen, the feature becomes active at the beginning of the current period 
and remains active in the subsequent periods without incurring additional development costs, though 
variable costs continue to apply as sales occur.  
 
Chapter III. Marketing 
 
The Marketing and Sales teams are tasked with setting product prices, allocating advertising budgets 
across various media, managing commercial efforts in the sales channels, and defining payment terms 
for each region. Below, details and impact of each of these decisions are reviewed. 
 
Section III.a: Price 
 
Companies can set different final customer prices for each product and market region where they 
wish to operate. Prices are set once at the beginning of the four-month period and remain fixed 
throughout the period. (i.e., they cannot be adjusted fortnightly). If you intentionally decide not to 
enter a market region or wish to exit a market in a period (regardless of the market share), you must 
set a sale price of zero for that region. Note that this will cause all marketing decisions to have no 
effect — for example, if you advertise in a market but set the price to zero, the advertising will have 
no impact on customer awareness.  
 
When determining your pricing policy, consider the varying price sensitivities of customer segments. 
The high-income segment is less price-sensitive than the low-income segment. While there is no 
regulated maximum price, excessively high prices can be perceived as unreasonable by the market. 
In such cases, distributors may suspend their orders entirely, leading to a potential loss of market 
presence.

During the 6th four-month period (the most recent period of Mezquite’s operations) the price set for 
each Electroclean was $68 in the Central and Western market regions. In the Northern market, 
however, the price was set at $91. This price difference is due to Mezquite's production plants being 
located in the Central and Western regions, while in the North, additional transportation costs are 
incurred to distribute products. Despite the higher price, the Northern population has shown moderate 
acceptance. Pricing for the South and East markets remains largely unknown. However, populations 
in these regions are likely to have rational limits, based on their budgets and alternative options, 
regarding what they perceive as a reasonable price. 
 
Section III.b: Advertising 
Advertising for the Electroclean is conducted through traditional media outlets: radio and television. 
The Marketing department is responsible for developing an advertising media plan based on available 
channels. A subcontracted advertising agency will handle the design, production, and media 
placement according to your plan. Instructors may choose to open up the possibility of using other 
advertising channels during the simulation, in which case additional instructions will be provided.  
The key elements to define for each period include: 
Ad intensity in each media (e.g., number of ads). For traditional media like TV and Radio, this 
intensity is defined by the number of spots to be broadcasted in each media for each region during a 
period. TV has global coverage across all regions so your advertising decisions will impact the five 
market regions simultaneously. Hence, you only have to decide the total number of spots. The impact 
of these spots is the same in all region and it is independent of how many regions are your present in. 
On the other hand, radio spots have a local reach and impact in each region and, hence, must be 
contracted region by region. Each spot has a unit cost which includes the basic production and 
broadcasting rights (see Table III.1 for a summary of media description and costs). 
Message focus. You need to strike a balance between two types of advertising focus: 
 A generic focus, which emphasizes your brand while linking it to the overall benefits of the 
Electroclean as a product category, and 
 A feature focus, which highlights the particular advantages and features that differentiate your 
company’s product from those of competitors. 
You can define this balance using percentages. For example, a 50% generic / 50% feature mix in TV 
advertising would give equal emphasis to general product benefits and your company’s specific 
differentiators. A 25% generic / 75% feature focus would lean more heavily on your product’s unique 
attributes. However, each orientation must have at least 10%, meaning the only acceptable extremes 
are 90/10 or 10/90 — a 100% focus on either side is not allowed. 
Generic focus is most effective in the early stages of market development, when customers are still 
unfamiliar with the product category. It helps to create awareness and associate the Electroclean 
concept with your brand name. Overloading customers with technical details at this stage may reduce 
ad effectiveness and make your brand less memorable. Moreover, a generic message creates an early 
demand for an Electroclean as it informs customers about the need and benefits. Aggregated 
advertisment by all companies generates the need to purchase an Electroclean and shall generally 
increase the overall demand for the product. 
On the other hand, the feature focus is better suited for customers who are already familiar with 
Electroclean and are considering a purchase. In this case, highlighting your product’s distinct features 
can help steer buyers toward your brand instead of a competitor’s. Feature focus becomes more 
relevant as the market matures and product penetration increases (i.e., later periods). It is also

necessary when, as a company, you invest in product innovation substantially as you may need to 
make your customers aware of your product’s new features. 
Media Strategy. When allocating the budget across media, companies need to consider the reach and 
impact of different media on the various segments of each market: TV advertising is used to address 
more affluent customer segments, while Radio should reach low-income segments with greater 
impact.  
It is important to consider the strong competition for consumers’ attention: the more competitors 
advertise, the harder it will be for your commercials to stand out and secure prime-time slots. 
Conversely, excessive overall advertising can lead to information saturation, resulting in diminishing 
returns as advertising efforts are significantly increased. 
To address this, we recommend maintaining a well-balanced communication strategy while closely 
monitoring the actions of competitors. This approach will help you avoid both overexposure and 
insufficient advertising efforts. 
Your total advertising expenses will include the combined cost of all your TV and Radio spots in a 
period. This total expense will be evenly distributed across eight fortnights and paid fortnightly 
throughout the period.

Section III.c: Channel Commercial Effort 
 
As described earlier, Electrocleans are primarily sold through distributors. The company must 
determine the level of commercial effort to allocate to developing and maintaining distributor 
relationships through a dedicated sales force. Sales representatives are responsible for regularly 
visiting local distributors to promote sales, discuss product placement, and encourage them to push 
Electrocleans to retailers. 
 
The size of your sales force, relative to that of your competitors, determines your distributor coverage 
in each region and the extent to which distributors prioritize your product over competitors’. A larger 
sales force can lead to higher sales by increasing influence at the distributor level. While a strong 
sales force is especially important during the early stages of market penetration, the need for constant 
supervision tends to decrease as distributors become loyal and your product gains market presence. 
Loyal distributors may maintain relatively strong sales volumes even with a smaller sales force. 
However, the effectiveness of your sales team will always depend on the actions of competitors in 
the region. 
 
Sales representatives are full-time employees. The company incurs a one-time hiring cost per new 
salesperson at the beginning of the period, covering recruitment and training expenses. Salespeople 
receive a fixed salary, paid fortnightly, and do not earn commissions. This salary cost is evenly 
--- Page 10 (pypdf) ---
IESE / IPADE  October 2025 review 
10
distributed across the eight fortnights of the period in which they are hired. Layoffs do not incur 
additional expenses. Table III. 2 summarizes the specific cost parameters of your workforce.  
 
Lost sales (potential demand generated but unmet) can frustrate the sales team. When this occurs, 
some sales representatives may resign, typically at the rate of one salesperson per region per month 
of lost sales. This resignation may happen even if the lost sales are only a small fraction of the total 
demand.

Section III.d: Payment Terms  
 
You may offer up to four different payment plans to distributors, with each plan involving additional 
discounts in exchange for faster payment. Within a region, all distributors are subject to the same 
payment terms, meaning you can select only one payment plan per region and period. Discounts tied 
to payment terms do not influence competitive market allocation. Offering higher discounts will not 
result in distributors or retail chains increasing their capacity to sell larger volumes. Payment plans 
are therefore a purely financial decision. 
 
Table III. 3 shows the discounts and payment periods.   
 
Table III. 3 Discounts and payment terms 
Payment type Payment term (fortnights) Discount 
A 0 13.0% 
B 2 7.5% 
C 4 2.5% 
D 8 0.0% 
 
 
From an accounting perspective, Electroclean units delivered to distributors are recorded as net sales 
revenues in your P&L at the distributor price (which is the final customer selling price minus the 
distributor margin). Discounts related to payment terms are then deducted to determine net sales 
revenue in the P&L. Notably, sales occur and are recorded only in even fortnights (at the end of a 
month). 
 
Accounts receivable arise when sales are recorded but payment is deferred based on the agreed 
payment terms. In the simulation, sales are recorded only in even fortnights, while payment 
collections depend on the type of payment terms agreed with the distributor. For example, if a 
distributor with payment terms of type C receives a sales order in the 2nd fortnight, your company will 
log that as receivable in the balance sheet and will only collect the cash payment after four fortnights, 
i.e., at the beginning of the 6th fortnight

Chapter IV. Production & Procurement 
 
The company must decide its production footprint, which involves determining (a) which of the 
regions has a production facility and (b) dimensioning the adequate size of the factory in terms of real 
estate (“plant modules”), equipment (“machines”), and workforce, according to a given production 
structure.  
 
Section IV.a: Manufacturing Process 
 
The production process is shown in Figure IV. 1. As seen from the figure: 
 
 The process is divided into five stages (or “sections”). 
 Eight different “Raw Materials” are necessary to manufacture the Electroclean: Parts A and B, 
and pieces 1 to 6 (the distinction between parts and pieces is detailed in the procurement section). 
The quantities needed for one finished product are specified in Figure IV. 1. 
 Sections 1 to 4 produce intermediate assemblies A, B, C, and D (“Work-in-Progress”) while 
Section 5 assembles the final product (“Finished Goods”).  
 Production time for each one of the five sections is one fortnight. For instance, parts A entering 
section 1 at the beginning of the fortnight are transformed into assemblies A at the end of that 
same fortnight and will be available in section 3 at the beginning of the next fortnight. Note that 
assemblies manufactured in the last fortnight of the previous period will arrive as input for 
production in the first fortnight in the new period in the next section. 
 Finished products (Electrocleans) in Section 5 are available to be shipped or sold in the same 
fortnight they are produced. 
To set your production schedule for a plant, you must define the regular production level for each 
section on a fortnightly basis, that is, the number of units to be produced in each section during regular 
working hours of every fortnight. Additionally, you may choose to enable Saturday overtime during 
selected fortnights, which allows you to produce up to 20% extra above the planned quantity for that 
fortnight. 
 
Your ability to reach the scheduled production levels will depend on both the section’s capacity and 
the productivity of your workforce. Each section's theoretical capacity is determined by the amount 
of equipment and labor allocated to it. However, actual production may vary, as nominal capacity can 
increase or decrease depending on employee satisfaction and its impact on productivity (see Section 
IVc on labor decisions).

Section IV.b: Equipment (“Machines”) 
 
The production process requires four types of machines (types 1, 2, 3, and 4) and labor for both 
operating the machines and performing additional manual tasks. Each section of the production 
process has specific machine and labor requirements: 
 
 Section 1: requires type 1 machines, each of which must be operated by one worker. 
 
 Section 2: requires type 2 machines, each of which must be operated by one worker. 
 
 Section 3: involves a two-step process that uses type 3 and type 4 machines sequentially on the 
same product. Therefore, the total production capacity of Section 3 is determined by the lower 
capacity between the installed type 3 and type 4 machines.  
 
o Type 3 machines are available in two versions: 3-alpha (less automated) and 3-beta 
(more automated). Both perform the same operations but differ in speed and the 
number of workers required. Importantly, neither version can function unless a 
sufficient number of workers is assigned. 
o Type 4 machines are operated by one worker. 
 
 Section 4: requires type 4 machines, with one worker per machine. Type 4 machines are versatile 
and can be used in Sections 3, 4, and 5. However, their capacity varies depending on the section, 
as they operate on different work-in-progress elements in each section.  
 
 Section 5: also requires type 4 machines, each operated by one worker. Additionally, 
complementary manual assembly tasks are performed by crews of three workers, who do not 
operate machinery. The actual production capacity of Section 5 is limited by the lower of the 
following two constraints:

o The capacity of the type 4 machines installed in the section 
o The capacity of the assembly crews. For example, 15 workers (i.e., 5 crews) with a 
productivity rate of 50 Electrocleans per crew can produce up to 250 Electrocleans 
per fortnight. 
 
Machines occupy physical space and sufficient factory space must be available to accommodate them. 
Each machine type requires a specific number of "spaces" within a factory module (see more details 
in Section IV.e "Facilities"). To ensure enough capacity for your equipment, you will need to purchase 
additional plant modules as necessary. Table IV. 1 shows the prices, capacities, space requirements, 
and number of employees needed per machine. It also includes the initial availability of each machine 
type in the Center and West regions.  
 
Purchase of machines. Machines are readily available and can begin operating immediately upon 
purchase, starting from the first fortnight of the four-month period, even when purchased for newly 
established plants. Payments for new machines are always charged at the beginning of the 
corresponding four-month period. Each machine has a defined operational lifetime, after which it 
ceases to function and must be replaced. Machine purchases are recorded as new fixed assets in the 
company’s books and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the machine's useful life. 
 
Resale of machines. Machines can be resold at 65% of their net book value, calculated as 65% of the 
purchase price minus accumulated depreciation. For example, a type 1 machine purchased for 
$10,600 at the start operations in Mezquite could be sold at $1,378 at the beginning of Period 9. This 
is based on a 35% discount, considering that after 8 periods of depreciation, the resale value is 65% 
of ($10,600 − $8,480). 
 
Transfer of machines. Machines can be transferred between plants in different regions as needed 
and will be operational at the beginning of the period. The transport cost for each transfer depends on 
the origin and destination, as detailed in Table IV. 2. Machines are transported by airplane, and the 
transfer takes one fortnight.

Energy consumption. All machines involved in the production of Electrocleans consume electricity. 
To calculate energy consumption, we assume that each machine has a nominal power rating ("power 
term"). Based on this, the actual consumption ("consumption term") is calculated by multiplying the 
power by the number of hours worked — that is, the total kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed. 
 
For example, a type 1 machine has a nominal power of 10 kW. If it operates at 100% capacity during 
a fortnight (i.e., 80 hours: 10 days × 8 working hours per day), it will consume 800 kWh in that 
fortnight, or 6,400 kWh per period. If a machine operates for less than 100% of the time, its energy 
consumption decreases proportionally. Table IV. 3 provides the installed nominal power for each 
machine type.

Cost for

Cost for 
consumption $0.06 / kWh 
 
Electricity is supplied by the local utility company which charges for both the Power term (“kW of 
power installed”) and the consumption of electricity (“Consumption term”): 
 Power term: this is a fixed charge for the period, payable regardless of the actual energy 
consumed. It ensures the availability of the required electrical power in kW. The cost per kW is 
detailed in Table IV. 3. For instance, if the total installed power for all machines in Period 7 is 
637 kW, the power term cost would be $6,370.  
 
 Consumption term: this is the variable charge based on actual energy consumption (in kWh). 
The cost per kWh is also shown in Table IV. 3. For instance, at a rate of $0.06/kWh, and with 
637 kW of installed power, if machines operate at 100% capacity, they would consume 50,960 
kWh per fortnight, or 407,680 kWh per period, resulting in a total energy cost of $24,460.80.   
The total electricity cost appears in the P&L, while payments are recorded in the subperiod cashflow 
report. Additionally, the current electricity supplier uses a non-renewable energy mix, meaning that 
electricity consumption results in CO₂ emissions — a factor to be considered in your ESG 
performance (see Chapter VII Environmental sustainability). 
Several measures can be implemented to reduce both the external cost of electricity and the 
company’s CO₂ footprint—particularly by installing photovoltaic (PV) panels or sourcing electricity 
from green suppliers. If any of these measures are adopted, the corresponding savings (e.g., from PV

panels) or additional costs (e.g., from green energy providers) will be reflected accordingly in your 
P&L statement and in the cashflow report.  
 
Section IV.c: Raw Materials (“Parts and pieces”) and Work-in-progress (“Assemblies”) 
 
The production of an Electroclean requires eight raw materials (see Figure IV. 1): Parts A and B, as 
well as Pieces 1 through 6. Additionally, production involves managing four intermediate assemblies: 
A, B, C, and D.  
 
Procurement of pieces. Pieces (1–6) are commodity materials that must be purchased at the 
beginning of the period in a single order. Due to their nature, the ordering cost is negligible. Orders 
are delivered at the beginning of the first fortnight of the period in which they are placed. Suppliers 
deliver these pieces in batches, with batch sizes and prices detailed in Table IV. 4. 
 
Procurement of parts: Parts A and B are specialized materials that can be ordered in partial 
deliveries. Orders may be placed in any given fortnight and are available for use within the same 
fortnight. Each order incurs an ordering cost to account for administrative expenses, separate from 
the cost of the materials themselves (see Table IV. 4). These costs are paid in the fortnight the order 
is placed. 
 
Three suppliers offer different purchasing terms and conditions, as summarized in Table IV. 4. 
Supplier A requires immediate payment upon delivery and does not offer any special terms. Supplier 
B offers a 2-fortnight payment term and a volume discount: 16% off for orders of 150 or more batches 
of parts A, and 16% off for orders of 80 or more batches of parts B. However, there is a 20% 
probability that this supplier will fail to deliver an order. In such cases, the order is cancelled and no 
payment will be made to the supplier. Supplier C offers an 8-fortnight payment term but no discounts. 
 
Inventory Management. The inventories of parts A and B, and assemblies A, B, C, and D incur an 
inventory holding cost (including factory warehouse salaries, insurance, obsolescence, impairment, 
and storage space). These costs are paid fortnightly, based on the stock levels observed at the end of 
each fortnight. While inventories of pieces are maintained, their holding costs are negligible and 
therefore not accounted for.

Section IV.d: Facilities (”Plant Modules”) 
 
Facilities encompass all the land area required at the manufacturing sites for production, material 
flow, and storage, as well as proportional space for offices and other support functions. Note that 
storage of finished goods is managed separately in external warehousing facilities (see Chapter V 
Logistics). 
 
To streamline real estate planning and decision-making, the term “plant module” is used to represent 
facility space requirements. A plant module combines the various area components mentioned above. 
Each plant module contains 18 available spaces, with different machines occupying a specific number 
of spaces, as detailed in Table IV. 6. 
 
 
Table IV . 6 Space occupancy per machine 
 Machine 1 Machine 2 Machine 3 Machine 4 ALPHA BETA 
Spaces 1 1 5 6 1 
 
 
Purchase and dimensioning of modules. You must ensure that you have enough modules and spaces 
to accommodate all available machines. If the number of modules is insufficient, the system will 
automatically lease the additional modules required for the period — at a very high cost. This is an 
emergency measure to avoid production stoppages. The shortage of modules must be resolved in the 
next period to prevent further leasing. 
 
Module purchases or leases are paid at the beginning of the period. Purchased plant modules represent 
a real estate investment added to your fixed assets; they do not generate depreciation in the balance 
sheet. 
 
You may also open new plants in the Northern, Eastern, and Southern regions. However, to protect 
employment and preserve the nation’s current revenues, the government has enacted a law restricting 
the relocation of facilities. As a result, you must maintain at least one plant module in any region 
where you have begun operations. 
 
Module purchase prices, leasing costs, occupancy capacity (in spaces and modules), and the current 
number of modules owned by the company are detailed in Table IV. 7. 
 
Resale of modules. Plant modules can be resold at their purchase value.  
 
General and administrative expenses. The company will also incur general and administrative 
expenses (e.g., administrative staff, services, property tax). These G&A expenses are assumed to be 
directly related to the number of plant modules — that is, proportional to the company’s production 
size. The administrative cost per module and four-month period is shown in Table IV. 7 and is evenly 
distributed across the eight fortnights of the period.

Chapter V. Logistics 
 
Products are never shipped directly from manufacturing facilities to customers. Instead, all 
manufacturing output is first stored in the regional warehouse located within the same region. From 
these warehouses, the company distributes products to distributors and other sales channels (if any). 
To ensure product availability, the company must maintain adequate warehouse capacity in each 
region where it plans to sell its products, and coordinate inter-warehouse shipments when necessary. 
 
 
Section V.a: Warehousing  
 
Warehouse capacity is rented from logistics operators under fixed-period agreements, as the company 
does not own its warehousing facilities. Capacity is negotiated based on the number of modules, each 
with a fixed rental cost per period and a fixed storage capacity for finished products. Table V. 1 
shows the values for these parameters as well as the available capacity at the end of Period 6.  
 
Capacity Planning. The required warehousing capacity must be defined at the beginning of each 
period for every region and remains fixed for the entire period. If the planned capacity is insufficient 
to store stock at the end of any fortnight, the excess stock will be deemed non-storable, considered 
damaged, and discarded. This lost stock will be recorded as a direct inventory loss, deducted from the 
balance sheet, and recognized in the P&L as an additional direct cost of goods sold (valued at zero 
price), resulting in a loss. 
 
Inventory Prioritization. Inventory priorities are assigned each fortnight based on company policies 
and scheduled shipments: 
1. First, shipments arriving from other regions during the fortnight and local finished production 
from the previous fortnight are added to the warehouse inventory. 
2. Next, shipments scheduled to other regions are prioritized from the available stock. If there is no 
stock left to fulfill these shipments, they remain unfulfilled. 
3. Finally, any remaining inventory is allocated to fulfill local sales within the region. 
 
Impact of Lost Sales. If inventory is insufficient to meet local sales demand, sales will be lost in that 
region. Lost sales within a period due to insufficient inventory cannot be reallocated to another team 
in the same period. The simulator penalizes lost sales by reducing demand for the affected region in 
the following period.

Section V.b: Transportation  
 
Deliveries between regional warehouses are managed through independent freight transportation 
services, as Mezquite does not operate its own fleet. The company can choose among three modes of 
transportation: truck, train, and airplane. For each shipment, decisions must be made regarding the 
origin and destination, the quantity to be shipped, the fortnight of dispatch, and the selected 
transportation mode 
 
Due to the product’s bulkiness, high value, and fragility, transportation is both time-consuming and 
costly. Transport fees, delivery times, and reliability vary significantly by mode. Table V. 2 provides 
a qualitative comparison of transportation modes to help evaluate their respective advantages and 
disadvantages.

 Airplane Truck Train 
Average speed Fast Slow Slow 
Compliance with delivery Reliable Not very reliable Highly uncertain 
Fees Very expensive Expensive Cheap 
Discounts per volume Not offered Between 6%-19% Between 11%-27% 
 
 
Transport costs. They include door-to-door freight charges, insurance, and any applicable 
import/export duties between regions. Volume-based discounts may apply (see Table V. 3 for cost 
details by mode, origin–destination, and shipment volume). Freight service payments are made in the 
fortnight the shipment is dispatched.  
 
Shipment Transit Times. Transit times depend on the transportation mode selected and may vary. 
Table V. 4 outlines the expected transit time distributions for each mode and origin–destination pair, 
expressed as probabilities of full shipment arrival in a given fortnight. For example: East-to-South 
shipments by truck have a 50% probability of arriving in full within 5 fortnights and a 50% probability 
of arriving within 6 fortnights. Airplane shipments are always 100% reliable and take exactly one 
fortnight. Note: Shipments scheduled to arrive after the period ends will appear in reports with the 
status “In Transit” until delivered in the subsequent period.

at the beginning of each period. Details on the number of workers needed per machine and section — 
including manual labor crews in Section 5 — are provided in Chapter IV. Workforce allocation will 
remain constant throughout the period. 
 
Workers can be reassigned between sections within the same plant, but cannot be transferred between 
facilities. Current agreements prohibit inter-plant employee transfers; therefore, relocating a worker 
to another plant requires terminating their employment at the original facility and rehiring them at the 
new location. 
 
Hiring and layoffs. The number of new hires or layoffs is calculated as the difference between the 
workforce from the previous period and the proposed workforce for the current period, determined 
separately for each plant. When the workforce increases, hiring takes place at the beginning of the 
period, and the company incurs a one-time cost per hire to cover contracting and training expenses. 
When the workforce decreases, layoffs occur at the beginning of the period, and severance payments 
are made for each worker laid off. 
 
Regular Salaries. In addition to hiring and layoff costs, workers receive fortnightly salaries, which 
the company must set for each region at the start of each period. Salaries remain fixed throughout the 
period and must (i) be higher than the government-mandated minimum wage, and (ii) remain 
competitive to avoid internal tensions, particularly if other companies in the region offer higher 
wages. 
 
Overtime costs. Managers may schedule overtime during specific fortnights, allowing for a 20% 
increase in production (equivalent to adding Saturday as a workday). Workers earn an additional $12 
per fortnight of overtime, paid in the same fortnight it is worked.  
 
Indirect Production Expenses. In addition to direct labor costs, indirect production expenses are 
incurred to support operations. These include salaries for foremen, quality control staff, maintenance 
teams, and other support roles. Such expenses are calculated as 50% of the total factory workers’ 
salaries (including overtime) and are allocated evenly across the fortnights. 
 
Table V1. 1 summarizes the main prevailing hiring, layoff, and salary conditions, and shows the 
current number of workers allocated to each section.

Section VI.b: Social Benefits 
 
The People Department is responsible for implementing improved working conditions and labor 
benefits to enhance employee satisfaction, reduce absenteeism, and boost productivity. Improving 
labor conditions and workforce motivation is a priority mandated by the company’s owners, 
particularly in light of the recent unionization of a significant majority of the workforce. Low morale 
and inconsistent labor practices could lead to strikes, further emphasizing the importance of this 
initiative. 
 
Salaries.  They are a key factor influencing employee satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Significant 
disparities in wages or benefits among competing companies can result in higher absenteeism and 
lower productivity. Currently, all companies offer fortnightly wages slightly above the country’s 
minimum salary, which is generally insufficient to inspire long-term loyalty or motivation 
 
Additional Benefits. Beyond salaries, the company can introduce various benefits to improve 
employee satisfaction, such as health insurance, extended personal days, training programs, improved 
workplace safety, and other perks that may yield productivity gains. Table VI. 2 outlines the full 
range of available benefits. By strategically combining wages with these additional benefits, the 
company can enhance workforce motivation. 
 
Employee satisfaction is measured at the end of each period. Higher satisfaction levels are expected 
to correlate directly with increased productivity, driven by reduced absenteeism and improved day-
to-day engagement.

Chapter VII. Environmental Sustainability (ESG) 
 
Sustainability has become a critical focus area for modern businesses. As a management team, you 
are responsible for addressing not only the environmental impact of your company’s operations but 
also the welfare of your employees. This extends the scope of responsibility towards a comprehensive 
ESG4 (Environmental, Social, and Governance) approach. 
 
Your company’s environmental footprint will be measured by total CO₂ emissions, based on a full 
analysis of your operations and any abatement measures implemented. Your ESG policy must be 
reviewed and approved, as any other strategic decision, by the Board of Directors. Public disclosure 
of your company’s environmental friendliness by activist organizations could significantly influence 
market and regulatory perceptions. In addition, the Board expects an annual 15% reduction in your 
carbon footprint. Failure to meet this target was one of the key reasons the previous management 
committee was asked to step down. 
 
The following sections provide a concise overview of the main sources of CO₂ emissions you must 
account for, as well as the actions your company can take to reduce their impact. 
 
4 We focus specifically on the "ES" components, with the Government (“G”) aspect deferred to future editions. 
For simplicity, the ESG designation is maintained.

Section VII.a: Sources of CO2 Emissions  
The complete list of elements contributing to CO₂ emissions is outlined below. Table VII. 1 specifies 
the CO₂ emissions per unit for each source. Total emissions are calculated by multiplying the 
operational volumes by these per-unit emission factors. 
The complete list of elements that generate CO2 emissions is described below. The simulation will 
provide you with detailed reports with an estimation of your actual emissions as well as the impact 
of your abatement decisions. You are not expected to calculate exactly the emissions for each CO₂ 
source, but rather to understand how they are generated and make appropriate decisions to reduce 
them5. 
Raw Materials (Parts). Parts A and B purchased contribute to CO₂ emissions from both their 
manufacturing (by suppliers) and their transportation to our facilities. These emissions must be 
included in the final product’s carbon footprint. Emissions vary by supplier due to differences in 
manufacturing technology (more or less polluting) and origin (affecting transport-related emissions). 
In our case, emissions are recorded at the moment of purchase, not at assembly or sale. Table VII. 1 
shows the estimated emissions per part purchased. 
Manufacturing. During production, machines consume electricity, and the company must account 
for the CO₂ emissions generated from producing this electricity. The attributable emissions depend 
on total energy consumption and the quality of the electricity mix used. Currently, our mix is not very 
“green,” producing 0.4 kg CO₂ per kWh consumed. If machines operate below full capacity, energy 
use—and thus emissions—are calculated proportionally to utilization.   
Product Improvements. Certain product improvements require additional components or 
postponement activities that can increase or reduce the product’s carbon footprint compared to the 
standard version. Some features will raise CO₂ emissions per unit, others will lower them. Since 
postponement occurs at the moment of sale, these emission changes are recorded then. Note: these 
emissions are separate from customer perceptions of the product’s environmental friendliness. 
Construction of Factories. Building new plant modules generates substantial CO₂ emissions due to 
the materials used and energy consumed. Emissions are calculated per module at the time of 
construction. In line with good accounting practices, these emissions are distributed evenly over 12 
periods to reflect the lifecycle of the asset.  
Transportation of Electrocleans. All transportation of finished products will also incur CO2 
emissions. Emissions generated by a shipment are a function of the distance and weight/volume 
transported, and the mode of transportation used, airplane being the most polluting mode (e.g., 800 gr 
CO2/ton/km), followed by truck (e.g., 250 gr CO2/ton/km), and then train (e.g., 85 gr CO2/ton/km). To 
help your analysis, the parameter table below already provides details for each origin-destination and 
mode, the estimated kg CO2 per Electroclean shipped (assuming a given distance for each origin-
destination and Electroclean weight). These emissions are recognized at the moment of departure of 
the shipment.  
Transportation of machines. When machines are transferred between factories, they are transported 
by air at the start of the period. Emissions are calculated proportionally to an Electroclean’s emissions 
using a “machine correction factor,” provided in Table VII. 1. 
 
5 Note that emissions reported may not completely match your own calculations.

Disposal of Products (due to lack of warehouse capacity). Any Electroclean discarded due to 
insufficient warehouse capacity must be transported to a recycling center for disassembly and material 
recovery. These activities also generate CO₂ emissions.

Section VII.b: Actions to Reduce/Offset CO2 Emissions.  
Management has four different options to reduce or offset CO2 emissions and improve the company’s 
environmental performance. Table VII.2 summarizes the cost and expected impact of each option. 
Solar Panels. Solar panels generate clean electricity with zero emissions. This is an investment paid 
at the beginning of the period, added to ESG fixed assets, and depreciated over the panels’ lifetime 
(see cost and lifespan in Table VII.2). In emissions accounting, the amount of green energy produced 
offsets an equivalent amount of CO₂ emissions from “non-green” electricity used by machines, 
resulting in a negative adjustment to reported emissions.   
Purchase Green Energy. The company can buy a percentage of its electricity needs from an eco-
friendly provider. This increases electricity costs but generates zero emissions for the amount 
purchased. The green energy purchased offsets an equivalent amount of CO₂ emissions from “non-
green” electricity consumed by machines. 
Tree Planting. Tree planting campaigns can be used to compensate for CO₂ emissions, thereby 
reducing net CO₂ emissions. The cost of planting is paid at the beginning of the period, and trees incur 
a maintenance cost every fortnight. Table VII.2 provides the CO₂ absorption ratio per tree, along 
with planting and maintenance costs.  
Purchase CO2 Credits. The company can purchase carbon credits, each offsetting 1 ton of CO₂. 
Prices vary depending on the purchase horizon (1, 2, or 3 periods) and the period in which the credits 
are acquired.

Section VII.c: Environmental Reporting (Emissions Report) 
The simulator provides a complete summary report of your emissions by category and the 
corresponding emissions offsets achieved through abatement measures. It also provides three key 
summary metrics: 
 Emissions Intensity per Period: measured as the total kg CO₂ per unit produced. Your Board 
requires this figure to be reduced by at least 15% by the end of each year. For example, if your 
Period 6 intensity is 29.93 kg CO₂/unit, emissions should decline progressively in Periods 7, 8, 
and 9 so that, by Period 9, intensity is below 25.4 kg CO₂/unit, and below 21.6 kg CO₂/unit by 
Period 12. 
 
 ENV KPI (%): the Environmental KPI is a performance score from 0% to 100% assessing your 
emissions reduction achievements, as reported by an independent environmental audit firm 
(100% corresponds to an A+ rating). The evaluation compares your emissions trajectory with that 
of market competitors and against standardized industry targets. The exact algorithm used—
including minimum thresholds, industry percentiles, and weightings—is not disclosed by the 
auditor. 
 
 ESG KPI (%): this KPI is a weighted average of the company’s Environmental positioning 
(ENV-KPI) and its Social positioning, represented by the Workforce Mood indicator/Productivity 
factor resulting from labor relations decisions. This KPI evaluates each company from an ESG 
perspective and compares its performance with that of other companies in the same environment. 
The ESG KPI ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) and reflects the company’s standing relative to 
the market average. 
 
Chapter VIII. Finance 
 
The company’s Finance Department is responsible for: (a) monitoring financial performance, (b) 
overseeing expenditures and investments, and (c) ensuring both short-term and long-term liquidity 
(i.e., maintaining sufficient cash for operations and planned investments). In collaboration with the 
CEO, it is also responsible for defining a coherent balance between debt and equity. The company’s 
financial situation at the end of Period 6 is presented in Chapter IX.   
 
Section VIII.a: Financial instruments 
 
The company has access to various short-term and long-term financing options, which may evolve 
over time as market conditions and company performance change. Limits, interest rates, and other 
terms may be adjusted as the simulation progresses. Table VIII. 1 provides a complete description 
of the available options, interest rates, and limits for this version of the case. 
 
Short-term financing: 
 
 Short-term line of credit. An unsecured facility provided by the company’s local bank, available 
on a fortnight-by-fortnight basis up to a limit established at the beginning of each period. Interest 
rates and limits may change from one period to another as banks update their terms. Table VIII. 
1 details the prevailing conditions. 
In any period, the maximum total amount available under the line of credit is capped at a given 
percentage of the company’s net fixed assets, as measured at the end of the previous period. This 
limit may eventually be indexed to other parameters, depending on the terms set by the bank (see 
--- Page 31 (pypdf) ---
IESE / IPADE  October 2025 review 
31
Table VIII. 1 for the current limit). For example, with net fixed assets totaling $697,625 at the 
end of Period 6, the credit line limit for Period 7 is $230,216. Given that the starting balance for 
Period 7 is $113,000, the company can still draw up to an additional $117,216 during Period 7. 
Interest on the outstanding balance is accrued fortnightly, based on the closing balance of each 
fortnight (see Table VIII. 1 for exact rates and limits). 
 
 Short-term deposits. Cash surpluses can be invested in short-term deposit accounts to earn 
interest income. Deposits can be adjusted fortnightly, allowing funds to be added or withdrawn 
as needed. Interest is calculated on the deposit balance at the end of each fortnight and credited 
to the company on a fortnightly basis. Applicable interest rates are shown in Table VIII. 1. 
 
 Other products. Other short-term financing alternatives may become available during the 
simulation and will be discussed with the instructor or the participating bank. 
 
Long-term financing: 
  
 Mortgages. The bank offers mortgages to finance long-term investments such as plant modules, 
machinery, product improvements, solar panels or tree planting campaigns. As of the end of 
Period 6, the company already has active mortgages with a defined repayment schedule (see 
Table VIII. 1 for details). 
New mortgages must be negotiated and approved by the bank individually at the beginning of 
each period. The process for setting interest rates and repayment terms may vary and will be 
clarified at the start of the simulation. Interest is calculated on the total mortgage balance at the 
beginning of the period and is payable at the start of the following period. For example, if the 
mortgage balance is increased by $100,000 to a total of $600,000 at the beginning of a period, 
and the interest rate is 6%, the company will accrue interest expenses of $36,000, payable at the 
beginning of the next period. Interest accrued in the prior period must also be paid at the 
beginning of the current period.  
Emergency loan. The company must maintain a positive cash position (a) at the beginning of each 
period after accounting for all initial payments (i.e., in the initial cash flow) and (b) after each 
subsequent fortnight (i.e., in the subperiod cash flows; see Section VIII.b). If the cash position 
becomes negative at any of these points, the company will automatically receive an emergency loan 
to cover the shortfall, preventing a temporary default on payments. 
 
The emergency loan is issued for the exact amount required to cover the deficit and carries a 
significantly high interest rate (e.g., 30% per four-month period). Emergency loans taken during the 
period accumulate and remain outstanding until the period ends, even if multiple loans are issued in 
different fortnights. Interest accrues for the remainder of the period, regardless of whether the 
company’s cash position later improves. Repayment does not occur within the same period; instead, 
at the start of the next period, accrued interest is paid first, followed by repayment of the principal 
during the first fortnight. 
 
The emergency loan is strictly a last-resort mechanism of the game and must not be used intentionally 
as a regular financing tool. Deliberate reliance on this facility is considered equivalent to a de facto 
bankruptcy if the amounts are substantial, and is prohibited. Such misuse would reflect extremely 
poorly on the Chief Financial Officer and the management team. 
 
Additional financing instruments may, over the course of the simulation, be requested by companies 
or made available by the bank or other stakeholders.

Section VIII.b: Cashflows Management and Schedule  
 
The company must manage a detailed schedule of receipts (cash inflows) and payments (cash 
outflows) to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained at all times during the period. To achieve this, it 
is essential to distinguish between initial cash flows and subperiod (fortnight) cash flows. 
 
Initial cash flow. These occur at the very beginning of the period, before any operations have 
commenced. They are typically associated with long-term decisions (e.g., plant and equipment 
purchases, product improvements, mortgages), operational decisions fixed for the duration of the 
period (e.g., hiring of sales force, warehouse rentals, payments for parts), or obligations carried over 
from previous periods (e.g., taxes, interest, and other payables). 
 
Subperiod (fortnight) cash flow”. These occur fortnightly during the operational phase of the 
period. They are linked either to decisions executed in specific fortnights (e.g., parts purchases, 
shipments, use of short-term lines of credit) or to recurring payments (e.g., salaries, energy costs).  
 
To assist the Finance Department in maintaining visibility over payment schedules, a detailed list of 
receipts and payments is provided in Table VIII. 2.

EXECUTIVE SIMULATION: MEZQUITE INC
Introduction
Founded by a well-renowned business dynasty, Mezquite Inc. is a small growing company created to
sell and manufacture electrical household appliances based on new, open-source technology. The
ELECTROCLEAN, the first product sold by the company, is the first appliance of its kind on the
market and aims to develop a whole new category in the competitive home appliance landscape. As
stated by a member of the third generation of the dynasty and the leading family member involved in
launching the company “we want the ELECTROCLEAN to be an integral part of every household”.
Two years after its launch, the owners have decided to change the company’s management to
accelerate growth and spur global expansion. Recognizing your leadership skills and expertise, you
have been recruited to join this new management team.
The company operates in a competitive market alongside similar firms that have also utilized the
same technology to develop equivalent products. At the start of your tenure, all companies in this
emerging industry segment are in the same competitive position: 1) they sell an identical
ELECTROCLEAN product with the same initial characteristics, 2) they have achieved comparable
sales and market share in the regions where the product is available, and 3) they share similar
production capabilities, financials, and company histories.
The decision-making process: the simulation context
As the new management team, you are responsible for making strategic, tactical, and operational
decisions over the coming years of the company — unless you are dismissed due to poor performance,
mismanagement, or lack of trust from the Board of Directors.
Case drafted by professors Albert Girbal Puig, Alejandro Lago and Àlex Grasas from the Production, Technology and Operations
Management Department of the IESE Business School, and Arturo Orozco Leyva, from the Operations Management Department of the
Instituto Panamericano de Alta Dirección de Empresa (IPADE), and, based on case “P 01 C 01” by Prof. Miguel Estrada, of the Operations
Management Department of IPADE to be used as basis for discussion and not as an example of adequate or inadequate management in a
specific situation.

Your decisions must span all key functional areas: product design, marketing and sales, operations,
logistics, finance, people, ESG1, etc. Importantly, these decisions must be aligned with a clear and
adaptable company strategy.
Time in the simulation is organized into Periods, each representing four months and composed of 8
fortnights of 10 working days (also called Subperiods), totaling 80 working days per period. Each
simulated year includes three periods, resulting in a full year of 240 working days (3 × 80). When
you take over as management, you begin at Period 7, which corresponds to the start of Year 3 of
operations.
At the start of each period, you must input all your company decisions into the simulation platform.
These decisions fall into two categories:
1. Period-wide decisions — these remain fixed for the entire four-month period (e.g., product
pricing, machinery purchases, long-term financing adjustments).
2. Fortnight-specific decisions — these allow for finer control (e.g., product shipments, credit
line changes) and must also be planned before the simulation run.
Important: All decisions for the period — both strategic and operational — must be submitted together
before the simulation run begins.
Once decisions are submitted, the simulation runs and generates detailed performance reports
covering market results, operational efficiency and financial outcomes. These reports reflect both
your company’s decisions and those of your competitors. You will use these outputs to evaluate your
strategy, identify mistakes or missed opportunities, and plan your actions for the next period.
Details on the company’s current market situation, your functional responsibilities, and how to
navigate the simulation platform are provided in the accompanying “Participant’s Guide”.
What follows provides details on the company’s market and financial situation, as well as the
functional responsibilities and decisions your team will need to address. Specific instructions on how
to access the simulation, input decisions, and analyze reports can be found in the accompanying
“Participant’s Guide”.
Chapter I. Global market context
Section I.a: Regions, Segments and Demand Forecasts
Market Regions. Mezquite operates in a global market divided into 5 distinct regions: Center, West,
North, East and South. Each region functions independently, with unique market demands and
customer behaviors specific to that region.
Customers Segments. Each region varies in population size and demographics. However, since
Electroclean represents a new product category, information on customers segment preferences and
behavior remains relatively scarce.
1 The term ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) refers to a series of criteria used to assess a company’s
performance and commitment in these areas. At Mezquite, certain decisions directly influence these criteria.

IESE / IPADE October 2025 review
Your marketing department has decided to divide the market into two primary sociodemographic
segments:
 High-end: This segment consists of individuals and families with medium-to-high incomes,
representing a smaller share of the population in each market. While evidence is not conclusive,
this group is expected to be less price-sensitive and place greater value on product performance,
advanced functionalities, and design.
 Low-end: This segment includes individuals with mid-to-low incomes (those with very low
incomes are not considered a target for the new appliance). It constitutes a larger portion of the
population in most markets. While generally more price-sensitive, their attitudes toward the
product are not yet fully understood. They are expected to prioritize performance and efficiency
but may also show interest in additional functionalities due to the novelty of the appliance.
Population and aggregated demand. The product has been introduced in the Central, West and
North regions over the past two years, achieving significant growth and market penetration. The East
and South regions remain untapped markets.
The estimated average household population per company for each segment and region is provided
in Table I. 1. The average demand per company (in units) observed during Periods 1 to 6 in the
markets where Mezquite is present is available in Table I. 2.
The simulation uses population and market demand data on a per-company basis, allowing it to scale
dynamically with the number of companies. To determine the total population size and total demand
for each market, the average values from the tables must be multiplied by the number of companies
operating in that market.

Low 74,800 51,000 50,400 40,000 20,400
(*) Target populations assume that, over the long term, Electrocleans could achieve a stable 22% to
25% penetration over the total households in the markets where it is being sold.

Historical sales data indicate some seasonality, with higher growth observed during the holiday
season in the last period of each year (Periods 3 and 6).
Future growth forecasts, however, lack industry consensus. Existing markets are expected to see
continued product penetration, though growth rates may slow or stagnate as penetration matures. The

East and South markets are anticipated to follow a similar trajectory but with significant uncertainty.
These markets could develop more rapidly due to the faster spread of information across regions.
Table I. 3 shows the expected annual demand per region in year 3 (comprising Periods 7, 8, and 9)
according to aggregated studies.
Table I. 3 Expected demand per company in Year 3 (in units)
Region Expected Demand in Year 3
East 3,000 to 5,000
South 2,500 to 3,500
Total demand, however, is subject to multiple factors influenced by aggregated company decisions,
including average market prices, total advertising expenditure, product appeal, and other variables. It
is the responsibility of the Marketing and Sales department to account for these uncertainties when
developing the company's forecasts.
Section I.b: Competitors Position
Competitors. The number of companies competing in each region may vary across simulations
(hence the need to use average demand per company).
At the beginning of Period 7, all competitors (including your company) offer the same entry-level
product in the Central, West, and North regions. Consequently, all competitors initially hold equal
market shares in these regions. For example, with five companies in the simulation, each would
control 20% of the market in each of these regions at the beginning of Period 7.
In the East and South regions, where no product has yet been introduced, the competitive landscape
is open. Market shares in these regions will depend on the sales generated by each company’s
decisions during the period. In the extreme scenario where only one company enters a new market,
that company would capture 100% of the market share for that period
The product and marketing decisions that your company makes in each region, compared to those of
your competitors, will determine the potential demand you can meet in each region (and consequently,
your potential sales and market share). Since each market operates independently, companies can
adopt distinct strategies for different regions. For example, a company might lead the market in the
Central region but hold minimal market share in the Western or Northern regions.
As markets evolve and mature, market shares are unlikely to shift dramatically from one period to the
next due to consumer inertia. This should be factored into your strategy when positioning your
company in each market. Gaining significant market share in a region where competitors are already
well-established may require sustained commercial effort over multiple periods.

IESE / IPADE October 2025 review
However, abrupt changes in market share can occur due to competitors' risky strategies or operational
failures. For instance:
 Pricing Missteps: Consumers have limits on their disposable income for appliances like
Electroclean. Excessively high prices or abrupt price changes can lead to sudden sales drops and
market share losses.
 Operational Failures: A company may be unable to fulfill the potential demand generated by
its commercial strategies due to poor operational planning, production issues, or inaccurate
forecasting. This results in lost sales and an actual reduced market share. In extreme cases, it
could even lead to the company being effectively pushed out of the market.
Section I.c: Channels and Sales
The primary distribution channel for Mezquite products consists of regional distributors. These
distributors are Mezquite’s direct customers and are responsible for supplying products to various
retailers through their proprietary networks of warehouses and transportation. Importantly, each
distributor operates exclusively within its assigned region, meaning distributors in one region are
entirely independent of those in other regions.
As the simulation progresses, additional sales channels may become available. These could include
direct sales to large retail chains, partnerships with online merchants (e.g., Amazon), or developing
your own e-commerce platform. However, the availability of these channels depends on the
simulation’s context and decisions made by the instructors. More details on the specifc decisions
needed to manage the distributior channel are given in Section III.c (Channel Commercial Effort).
The total demand generated by your company in a period is evenly divided across the 4 months. This
demand is allocated to the end of each month, corresponding to the even fortnights (fortnights 2, 4,
6, and 8). If you fail to meet the requested demand in any of the even fortnights, the unmet demand
in this month is lost and is considered a lost sale2. This process is independently verified in each of
the five market regions. To minimize lost sales, it is essential to plan and distribute your production
of Electrocleans to regional warehouses efficiently to meet demand on schedule.
Chapter II. Innovation
Mezquite currently commercializes a single product under a unique brand. Due to the early stage of
innovation and budgetary restrictions, the product offered in the market has limited features.
However, the Innovation department has been collaborating with marketing to define a range of
possible improvement features aimed at making the product more appealing to different market
segments.
As part of the innovation strategy, the company must decide which improvements are more relevant,
considering that these enhancements impact key customer preferences, such as design/aesthetics,
performance, and convenience. Different segments prioritize these dimensions differently, and these
preferences may evolve over time.
The Innovation department has evaluated the proposed features and estimated the upfront
development investment required to integrate each feature into a new Electroclean design. They have

own demand in the following periods.

IESE / IPADE October 2025 review
also estimated the extra variable cost per unit produced for each improvement, accounting for
increased labor and additional components. Notably, the improved features are incorporated into the
product during a just-in-sale postponement process at the company warehouses, right before the
product is shipped to distributors. This approach reduces production and logistics complexity by
maintaining only the basic product configuration in inventory. The improvements are applied at the
final stage, eliminating the need to produce, manage, and track different product variants throughout
the simulation. This strategy streamlines operations while offering flexibility in meeting customer
demands.
Table II. 1 provides a preliminary list of product features, along with their estimated upfront
development costs and extra variable production costs. The costs are additive, meaning that the total
investment and variable costs for incorporating multiple features are the sum of the individual costs
of those features.
The development costs are paid upfront at the beginning of the four-month period when the decision
to introduce the feature is made. The company accounting policy is to record these development costs
as intangible assets in the balance sheet and amortize them over the course of 3 periods.
The extra variable costs are incurred (and paid) at the time of sales (i.e., in the even fortnights). These
costs are calculated as the units sold multiplied by the extra unit cost. In the accounting records, they
are reflected in the P&L as an extra variable production cost item line (refer to Section VI for more
details).
Once an improvement is chosen, the feature becomes active at the beginning of the current period
and remains active in the subsequent periods without incurring additional development costs, though
variable costs continue to apply as sales occur.
Chapter III. Marketing
The Marketing and Sales teams are tasked with setting product prices, allocating advertising budgets
across various media, managing commercial efforts in the sales channels, and defining payment terms
for each region. Below, details and impact of each of these decisions are reviewed.
Section III.a: Price
Companies can set different final customer prices for each product and market region where they
wish to operate. Prices are set once at the beginning of the four-month period and remain fixed
throughout the period. (i.e., they cannot be adjusted fortnightly). If you intentionally decide not to
enter a market region or wish to exit a market in a period (regardless of the market share), you must
set a sale price of zero for that region. Note that this will cause all marketing decisions to have no
effect — for example, if you advertise in a market but set the price to zero, the advertising will have
no impact on customer awareness.
When determining your pricing policy, consider the varying price sensitivities of customer segments.
The high-income segment is less price-sensitive than the low-income segment. While there is no
regulated maximum price, excessively high prices can be perceived as unreasonable by the market.
In such cases, distributors may suspend their orders entirely, leading to a potential loss of market
presence.

During the 6th four-month period (the most recent period of Mezquite’s operations) the price set for
each Electroclean was $68 in the Central and Western market regions. In the Northern market,
however, the price was set at $91. This price difference is due to Mezquite's production plants being
located in the Central and Western regions, while in the North, additional transportation costs are
incurred to distribute products. Despite the higher price, the Northern population has shown moderate
acceptance. Pricing for the South and East markets remains largely unknown. However, populations
in these regions are likely to have rational limits, based on their budgets and alternative options,
regarding what they perceive as a reasonable price.
Section III.b: Advertising
Advertising for the Electroclean is conducted through traditional media outlets: radio and television.
The Marketing department is responsible for developing an advertising media plan based on available
channels. A subcontracted advertising agency will handle the design, production, and media
placement according to your plan. Instructors may choose to open up the possibility of using other
advertising channels during the simulation, in which case additional instructions will be provided.
The key elements to define for each period include:
Ad intensity in each media (e.g., number of ads). For traditional media like TV and Radio, this
intensity is defined by the number of spots to be broadcasted in each media for each region during a
period. TV has global coverage across all regions so your advertising decisions will impact the five
market regions simultaneously. Hence, you only have to decide the total number of spots. The impact
of these spots is the same in all region and it is independent of how many regions are your present in.
On the other hand, radio spots have a local reach and impact in each region and, hence, must be
contracted region by region. Each spot has a unit cost which includes the basic production and
broadcasting rights (see Table III.1 for a summary of media description and costs).
Message focus. You need to strike a balance between two types of advertising focus:
 A generic focus, which emphasizes your brand while linking it to the overall benefits of the
Electroclean as a product category, and
 A feature focus, which highlights the particular advantages and features that differentiate your
company’s product from those of competitors.
You can define this balance using percentages. For example, a 50% generic / 50% feature mix in TV
advertising would give equal emphasis to general product benefits and your company’s specific
differentiators. A 25% generic / 75% feature focus would lean more heavily on your product’s unique
attributes. However, each orientation must have at least 10%, meaning the only acceptable extremes
are 90/10 or 10/90 — a 100% focus on either side is not allowed.
Generic focus is most effective in the early stages of market development, when customers are still
unfamiliar with the product category. It helps to create awareness and associate the Electroclean
concept with your brand name. Overloading customers with technical details at this stage may reduce
ad effectiveness and make your brand less memorable. Moreover, a generic message creates an early
demand for an Electroclean as it informs customers about the need and benefits. Aggregated
advertisment by all companies generates the need to purchase an Electroclean and shall generally
increase the overall demand for the product.
On the other hand, the feature focus is better suited for customers who are already familiar with
Electroclean and are considering a purchase. In this case, highlighting your product’s distinct features
can help steer buyers toward your brand instead of a competitor’s. Feature focus becomes more
relevant as the market matures and product penetration increases (i.e., later periods). It is also

necessary when, as a company, you invest in product innovation substantially as you may need to
make your customers aware of your product’s new features.
Media Strategy. When allocating the budget across media, companies need to consider the reach and
impact of different media on the various segments of each market: TV advertising is used to address
more affluent customer segments, while Radio should reach low-income segments with greater
impact.
It is important to consider the strong competition for consumers’ attention: the more competitors
advertise, the harder it will be for your commercials to stand out and secure prime-time slots.
Conversely, excessive overall advertising can lead to information saturation, resulting in diminishing
returns as advertising efforts are significantly increased.
To address this, we recommend maintaining a well-balanced communication strategy while closely
monitoring the actions of competitors. This approach will help you avoid both overexposure and
insufficient advertising efforts.
Your total advertising expenses will include the combined cost of all your TV and Radio spots in a
period. This total expense will be evenly distributed across eight fortnights and paid fortnightly
throughout the period.

Radio Regional # of spots Min 10% generic / 90% feature $300/spot Higher reach in

Section III.c: Channel Commercial Effort
As described earlier, Electrocleans are primarily sold through distributors. The company must
determine the level of commercial effort to allocate to developing and maintaining distributor
relationships through a dedicated sales force. Sales representatives are responsible for regularly
visiting local distributors to promote sales, discuss product placement, and encourage them to push
Electrocleans to retailers.
The size of your sales force, relative to that of your competitors, determines your distributor coverage
in each region and the extent to which distributors prioritize your product over competitors’. A larger
sales force can lead to higher sales by increasing influence at the distributor level. While a strong
sales force is especially important during the early stages of market penetration, the need for constant
supervision tends to decrease as distributors become loyal and your product gains market presence.
Loyal distributors may maintain relatively strong sales volumes even with a smaller sales force.
However, the effectiveness of your sales team will always depend on the actions of competitors in
the region.
Sales representatives are full-time employees. The company incurs a one-time hiring cost per new
salesperson at the beginning of the period, covering recruitment and training expenses. Salespeople
receive a fixed salary, paid fortnightly, and do not earn commissions. This salary cost is evenly

additional expenses. Table III. 2 summarizes the specific cost parameters of your workforce.
Lost sales (potential demand generated but unmet) can frustrate the sales team. When this occurs,
some sales representatives may resign, typically at the rate of one salesperson per region per month
of lost sales. This resignation may happen even if the lost sales are only a small fraction of the total
demand.

Section III.d: Payment Terms
You may offer up to four different payment plans to distributors, with each plan involving additional
discounts in exchange for faster payment. Within a region, all distributors are subject to the same
payment terms, meaning you can select only one payment plan per region and period. Discounts tied
to payment terms do not influence competitive market allocation. Offering higher discounts will not
result in distributors or retail chains increasing their capacity to sell larger volumes. Payment plans
are therefore a purely financial decision.
Table III. 3 shows the discounts and payment periods.
Table III. 3 Discounts and payment terms
Payment type Payment term (fortnights) Discount
A 0 13.0%
B 2 7.5%
C 4 2.5%
D 8 0.0%
From an accounting perspective, Electroclean units delivered to distributors are recorded as net sales
revenues in your P&L at the distributor price (which is the final customer selling price minus the
distributor margin). Discounts related to payment terms are then deducted to determine net sales
revenue in the P&L. Notably, sales occur and are recorded only in even fortnights (at the end of a
month).
Accounts receivable arise when sales are recorded but payment is deferred based on the agreed
payment terms. In the simulation, sales are recorded only in even fortnights, while payment
collections depend on the type of payment terms agreed with the distributor. For example, if a
distributor with payment terms of type C receives a sales order in the 2nd fortnight, your company will
log that as receivable in the balance sheet and will only collect the cash payment after four fortnights,
i.e., at the beginning of the 6th fortnight

Chapter IV. Production & Procurement
The company must decide its production footprint, which involves determining (a) which of the
regions has a production facility and (b) dimensioning the adequate size of the factory in terms of real
estate (“plant modules”), equipment (“machines”), and workforce, according to a given production
structure.
Section IV.a: Manufacturing Process
The production process is shown in Figure IV. 1. As seen from the figure:
 The process is divided into five stages (or “sections”).
 Eight different “Raw Materials” are necessary to manufacture the Electroclean: Parts A and B,
and pieces 1 to 6 (the distinction between parts and pieces is detailed in the procurement section).
The quantities needed for one finished product are specified in Figure IV. 1.
 Sections 1 to 4 produce intermediate assemblies A, B, C, and D (“Work-in-Progress”) while
Section 5 assembles the final product (“Finished Goods”).
 Production time for each one of the five sections is one fortnight. For instance, parts A entering
section 1 at the beginning of the fortnight are transformed into assemblies A at the end of that
same fortnight and will be available in section 3 at the beginning of the next fortnight. Note that
assemblies manufactured in the last fortnight of the previous period will arrive as input for
production in the first fortnight in the new period in the next section.
 Finished products (Electrocleans) in Section 5 are available to be shipped or sold in the same
fortnight they are produced.
To set your production schedule for a plant, you must define the regular production level for each
section on a fortnightly basis, that is, the number of units to be produced in each section during regular
working hours of every fortnight. Additionally, you may choose to enable Saturday overtime during
selected fortnights, which allows you to produce up to 20% extra above the planned quantity for that
fortnight.
Your ability to reach the scheduled production levels will depend on both the section’s capacity and
the productivity of your workforce. Each section's theoretical capacity is determined by the amount
of equipment and labor allocated to it. However, actual production may vary, as nominal capacity can
increase or decrease depending on employee satisfaction and its impact on productivity (see Section
IVc on labor decisions).

Section IV.b: Equipment (“Machines”)
The production process requires four types of machines (types 1, 2, 3, and 4) and labor for both
operating the machines and performing additional manual tasks. Each section of the production
process has specific machine and labor requirements:
 Section 1: requires type 1 machines, each of which must be operated by one worker.
 Section 2: requires type 2 machines, each of which must be operated by one worker.
 Section 3: involves a two-step process that uses type 3 and type 4 machines sequentially on the
same product. Therefore, the total production capacity of Section 3 is determined by the lower
capacity between the installed type 3 and type 4 machines.
o Type 3 machines are available in two versions: 3-alpha (less automated) and 3-beta
(more automated). Both perform the same operations but differ in speed and the
number of workers required. Importantly, neither version can function unless a
sufficient number of workers is assigned.
o Type 4 machines are operated by one worker.
 Section 4: requires type 4 machines, with one worker per machine. Type 4 machines are versatile
and can be used in Sections 3, 4, and 5. However, their capacity varies depending on the section,
as they operate on different work-in-progress elements in each section.
 Section 5: also requires type 4 machines, each operated by one worker. Additionally,
complementary manual assembly tasks are performed by crews of three workers, who do not
operate machinery. The actual production capacity of Section 5 is limited by the lower of the
following two constraints:

o The capacity of the type 4 machines installed in the section
o The capacity of the assembly crews. For example, 15 workers (i.e., 5 crews) with a
productivity rate of 50 Electrocleans per crew can produce up to 250 Electrocleans
per fortnight.
Machines occupy physical space and sufficient factory space must be available to accommodate them.
Each machine type requires a specific number of "spaces" within a factory module (see more details
in Section IV.e "Facilities"). To ensure enough capacity for your equipment, you will need to purchase
additional plant modules as necessary. Table IV. 1 shows the prices, capacities, space requirements,
and number of employees needed per machine. It also includes the initial availability of each machine
type in the Center and West regions.
Purchase of machines. Machines are readily available and can begin operating immediately upon
purchase, starting from the first fortnight of the four-month period, even when purchased for newly
established plants. Payments for new machines are always charged at the beginning of the
corresponding four-month period. Each machine has a defined operational lifetime, after which it
ceases to function and must be replaced. Machine purchases are recorded as new fixed assets in the
company’s books and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the machine's useful life.
Resale of machines. Machines can be resold at 65% of their net book value, calculated as 65% of the
purchase price minus accumulated depreciation. For example, a type 1 machine purchased for
$10,600 at the start operations in Mezquite could be sold at $1,378 at the beginning of Period 9. This
is based on a 35% discount, considering that after 8 periods of depreciation, the resale value is 65%
of ($10,600 − $8,480).
Transfer of machines. Machines can be transferred between plants in different regions as needed
and will be operational at the beginning of the period. The transport cost for each transfer depends on
the origin and destination, as detailed in Table IV. 2. Machines are transported by airplane, and the
transfer takes one fortnight.

IESE / IPADE October 2025 review
Energy consumption. All machines involved in the production of Electrocleans consume electricity.
To calculate energy consumption, we assume that each machine has a nominal power rating ("power
term"). Based on this, the actual consumption ("consumption term") is calculated by multiplying the
power by the number of hours worked — that is, the total kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed.
For example, a type 1 machine has a nominal power of 10 kW. If it operates at 100% capacity during
a fortnight (i.e., 80 hours: 10 days × 8 working hours per day), it will consume 800 kWh in that
fortnight, or 6,400 kWh per period. If a machine operates for less than 100% of the time, its energy
consumption decreases proportionally. Table IV. 3 provides the installed nominal power for each
machine type.

consumption
Electricity is supplied by the local utility company which charges for both the Power term (“kW of
power installed”) and the consumption of electricity (“Consumption term”):
 Power term: this is a fixed charge for the period, payable regardless of the actual energy
consumed. It ensures the availability of the required electrical power in kW. The cost per kW is
detailed in Table IV. 3. For instance, if the total installed power for all machines in Period 7 is
637 kW, the power term cost would be $6,370.
 Consumption term: this is the variable charge based on actual energy consumption (in kWh).
The cost per kWh is also shown in Table IV. 3. For instance, at a rate of $0.06/kWh, and with
637 kW of installed power, if machines operate at 100% capacity, they would consume 50,960
kWh per fortnight, or 407,680 kWh per period, resulting in a total energy cost of $24,460.80.
The total electricity cost appears in the P&L, while payments are recorded in the subperiod cashflow
report. Additionally, the current electricity supplier uses a non-renewable energy mix, meaning that
electricity consumption results in CO₂ emissions — a factor to be considered in your ESG
performance (see Chapter VII Environmental sustainability).
Several measures can be implemented to reduce both the external cost of electricity and the
company’s CO₂ footprint—particularly by installing photovoltaic (PV) panels or sourcing electricity
from green suppliers. If any of these measures are adopted, the corresponding savings (e.g., from PV

panels) or additional costs (e.g., from green energy providers) will be reflected accordingly in your
P&L statement and in the cashflow report.
Section IV.c: Raw Materials (“Parts and pieces”) and Work-in-progress (“Assemblies”)
The production of an Electroclean requires eight raw materials (see Figure IV. 1): Parts A and B, as
well as Pieces 1 through 6. Additionally, production involves managing four intermediate assemblies:
A, B, C, and D.
Procurement of pieces. Pieces (1–6) are commodity materials that must be purchased at the
beginning of the period in a single order. Due to their nature, the ordering cost is negligible. Orders
are delivered at the beginning of the first fortnight of the period in which they are placed. Suppliers
deliver these pieces in batches, with batch sizes and prices detailed in Table IV. 4.
Procurement of parts: Parts A and B are specialized materials that can be ordered in partial
deliveries. Orders may be placed in any given fortnight and are available for use within the same
fortnight. Each order incurs an ordering cost to account for administrative expenses, separate from
the cost of the materials themselves (see Table IV. 4). These costs are paid in the fortnight the order
is placed.
Three suppliers offer different purchasing terms and conditions, as summarized in Table IV. 4.
Supplier A requires immediate payment upon delivery and does not offer any special terms. Supplier
B offers a 2-fortnight payment term and a volume discount: 16% off for orders of 150 or more batches
of parts A, and 16% off for orders of 80 or more batches of parts B. However, there is a 20%
probability that this supplier will fail to deliver an order. In such cases, the order is cancelled and no
payment will be made to the supplier. Supplier C offers an 8-fortnight payment term but no discounts.
Inventory Management. The inventories of parts A and B, and assemblies A, B, C, and D incur an
inventory holding cost (including factory warehouse salaries, insurance, obsolescence, impairment,
and storage space). These costs are paid fortnightly, based on the stock levels observed at the end of
each fortnight. While inventories of pieces are maintained, their holding costs are negligible and
therefore not accounted for.

Section IV.d: Facilities (”Plant Modules”)
Facilities encompass all the land area required at the manufacturing sites for production, material
flow, and storage, as well as proportional space for offices and other support functions. Note that
storage of finished goods is managed separately in external warehousing facilities (see Chapter V
Logistics).
To streamline real estate planning and decision-making, the term “plant module” is used to represent
facility space requirements. A plant module combines the various area components mentioned above.
Each plant module contains 18 available spaces, with different machines occupying a specific number
of spaces, as detailed in Table IV. 6.
Table IV. 6 Space occupancy per machine
Machine 3
Machine 1 Machine 2 Machine 4
ALPHA BETA
Spaces 1 1 5 6 1
Purchase and dimensioning of modules. You must ensure that you have enough modules and spaces
to accommodate all available machines. If the number of modules is insufficient, the system will
automatically lease the additional modules required for the period — at a very high cost. This is an
emergency measure to avoid production stoppages. The shortage of modules must be resolved in the
next period to prevent further leasing.
Module purchases or leases are paid at the beginning of the period. Purchased plant modules represent
a real estate investment added to your fixed assets; they do not generate depreciation in the balance
sheet.
You may also open new plants in the Northern, Eastern, and Southern regions. However, to protect
employment and preserve the nation’s current revenues, the government has enacted a law restricting
the relocation of facilities. As a result, you must maintain at least one plant module in any region
where you have begun operations.
Module purchase prices, leasing costs, occupancy capacity (in spaces and modules), and the current
number of modules owned by the company are detailed in Table IV. 7.
Resale of modules. Plant modules can be resold at their purchase value.
General and administrative expenses. The company will also incur general and administrative
expenses (e.g., administrative staff, services, property tax). These G&A expenses are assumed to be
directly related to the number of plant modules — that is, proportional to the company’s production
size. The administrative cost per module and four-month period is shown in Table IV. 7 and is evenly
distributed across the eight fortnights of the period.

Chapter V. Logistics
Products are never shipped directly from manufacturing facilities to customers. Instead, all
manufacturing output is first stored in the regional warehouse located within the same region. From
these warehouses, the company distributes products to distributors and other sales channels (if any).
To ensure product availability, the company must maintain adequate warehouse capacity in each
region where it plans to sell its products, and coordinate inter-warehouse shipments when necessary.
Section V.a: Warehousing
Warehouse capacity is rented from logistics operators under fixed-period agreements, as the company
does not own its warehousing facilities. Capacity is negotiated based on the number of modules, each
with a fixed rental cost per period and a fixed storage capacity for finished products. Table V. 1
shows the values for these parameters as well as the available capacity at the end of Period 6.
Capacity Planning. The required warehousing capacity must be defined at the beginning of each
period for every region and remains fixed for the entire period. If the planned capacity is insufficient
to store stock at the end of any fortnight, the excess stock will be deemed non-storable, considered
damaged, and discarded. This lost stock will be recorded as a direct inventory loss, deducted from the
balance sheet, and recognized in the P&L as an additional direct cost of goods sold (valued at zero
price), resulting in a loss.
Inventory Prioritization. Inventory priorities are assigned each fortnight based on company policies
and scheduled shipments:
1. First, shipments arriving from other regions during the fortnight and local finished production
from the previous fortnight are added to the warehouse inventory.
2. Next, shipments scheduled to other regions are prioritized from the available stock. If there is no
stock left to fulfill these shipments, they remain unfulfilled.
3. Finally, any remaining inventory is allocated to fulfill local sales within the region.
Impact of Lost Sales. If inventory is insufficient to meet local sales demand, sales will be lost in that
region. Lost sales within a period due to insufficient inventory cannot be reallocated to another team
in the same period. The simulator penalizes lost sales by reducing demand for the affected region in
the following period.

Section V.b: Transportation
Deliveries between regional warehouses are managed through independent freight transportation
services, as Mezquite does not operate its own fleet. The company can choose among three modes of
transportation: truck, train, and airplane. For each shipment, decisions must be made regarding the
origin and destination, the quantity to be shipped, the fortnight of dispatch, and the selected
transportation mode
Due to the product’s bulkiness, high value, and fragility, transportation is both time-consuming and
costly. Transport fees, delivery times, and reliability vary significantly by mode. Table V. 2 provides
a qualitative comparison of transportation modes to help evaluate their respective advantages and
disadvantages.
Table V. 2 Freight transportation options
Airplane Truck Train
Average speed Fast Slow Slow
Compliance with delivery Reliable Not very reliable Highly uncertain
Fees Very expensive Expensive Cheap
Discounts per volume Not offered Between 6%-19% Between 11%-27%
Transport costs. They include door-to-door freight charges, insurance, and any applicable
import/export duties between regions. Volume-based discounts may apply (see Table V. 3 for cost
details by mode, origin–destination, and shipment volume). Freight service payments are made in the
fortnight the shipment is dispatched.
Shipment Transit Times. Transit times depend on the transportation mode selected and may vary.
Table V. 4 outlines the expected transit time distributions for each mode and origin–destination pair,
expressed as probabilities of full shipment arrival in a given fortnight. For example: East-to-South
shipments by truck have a 50% probability of arriving in full within 5 fortnights and a 50% probability
of arriving within 6 fortnights. Airplane shipments are always 100% reliable and take exactly one
fortnight. Note: Shipments scheduled to arrive after the period ends will appear in reports with the
status “In Transit” until delivered in the subsequent period.

Chapter VI. People
Section VI.a: Factory Workers
Managers must decide on the appropriate number of workers required in each section of every plant
at the beginning of each period. Details on the number of workers needed per machine and section —
including manual labor crews in Section 5 — are provided in Chapter IV. Workforce allocation will
remain constant throughout the period.
Workers can be reassigned between sections within the same plant, but cannot be transferred between
facilities. Current agreements prohibit inter-plant employee transfers; therefore, relocating a worker
to another plant requires terminating their employment at the original facility and rehiring them at the
new location.
Hiring and layoffs. The number of new hires or layoffs is calculated as the difference between the
workforce from the previous period and the proposed workforce for the current period, determined
separately for each plant. When the workforce increases, hiring takes place at the beginning of the
period, and the company incurs a one-time cost per hire to cover contracting and training expenses.
When the workforce decreases, layoffs occur at the beginning of the period, and severance payments
are made for each worker laid off.
Regular Salaries. In addition to hiring and layoff costs, workers receive fortnightly salaries, which
the company must set for each region at the start of each period. Salaries remain fixed throughout the
period and must (i) be higher than the government-mandated minimum wage, and (ii) remain
competitive to avoid internal tensions, particularly if other companies in the region offer higher
wages.
Overtime costs. Managers may schedule overtime during specific fortnights, allowing for a 20%
increase in production (equivalent to adding Saturday as a workday). Workers earn an additional $12
per fortnight of overtime, paid in the same fortnight it is worked.
Indirect Production Expenses. In addition to direct labor costs, indirect production expenses are
incurred to support operations. These include salaries for foremen, quality control staff, maintenance
teams, and other support roles. Such expenses are calculated as 50% of the total factory workers’
salaries (including overtime) and are allocated evenly across the fortnights.
Table V1. 1 summarizes the main prevailing hiring, layoff, and salary conditions, and shows the
current number of workers allocated to each section.

Section VI.b: Social Benefits
The People Department is responsible for implementing improved working conditions and labor
benefits to enhance employee satisfaction, reduce absenteeism, and boost productivity. Improving
labor conditions and workforce motivation is a priority mandated by the company’s owners,
particularly in light of the recent unionization of a significant majority of the workforce. Low morale
and inconsistent labor practices could lead to strikes, further emphasizing the importance of this
initiative.
Salaries. They are a key factor influencing employee satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Significant
disparities in wages or benefits among competing companies can result in higher absenteeism and
lower productivity. Currently, all companies offer fortnightly wages slightly above the country’s
minimum salary, which is generally insufficient to inspire long-term loyalty or motivation
Additional Benefits. Beyond salaries, the company can introduce various benefits to improve
employee satisfaction, such as health insurance, extended personal days, training programs, improved
workplace safety, and other perks that may yield productivity gains. Table VI. 2 outlines the full
range of available benefits. By strategically combining wages with these additional benefits, the
company can enhance workforce motivation.
Employee satisfaction is measured at the end of each period. Higher satisfaction levels are expected
to correlate directly with increased productivity, driven by reduced absenteeism and improved day-
to-day engagement.

Chapter VII. Environmental Sustainability (ESG)
Sustainability has become a critical focus area for modern businesses. As a management team, you
are responsible for addressing not only the environmental impact of your company’s operations but
also the welfare of your employees. This extends the scope of responsibility towards a comprehensive
ESG4 (Environmental, Social, and Governance) approach.
Your company’s environmental footprint will be measured by total CO₂ emissions, based on a full
analysis of your operations and any abatement measures implemented. Your ESG policy must be
reviewed and approved, as any other strategic decision, by the Board of Directors. Public disclosure
of your company’s environmental friendliness by activist organizations could significantly influence
market and regulatory perceptions. In addition, the Board expects an annual 15% reduction in your
carbon footprint. Failure to meet this target was one of the key reasons the previous management
committee was asked to step down.
The following sections provide a concise overview of the main sources of CO₂ emissions you must
account for, as well as the actions your company can take to reduce their impact.
4 We focus specifically on the "ES" components, with the Government (“G”) aspect deferred to future editions.
For simplicity, the ESG designation is maintained.

Section VII.a: Sources of CO Emissions
2
The complete list of elements contributing to CO₂ emissions is outlined below. Table VII. 1 specifies
the CO₂ emissions per unit for each source. Total emissions are calculated by multiplying the
operational volumes by these per-unit emission factors.
The complete list of elements that generate CO emissions is described below. The simulation will
2
provide you with detailed reports with an estimation of your actual emissions as well as the impact
of your abatement decisions. You are not expected to calculate exactly the emissions for each CO₂
source, but rather to understand how they are generated and make appropriate decisions to reduce
them5.
Raw Materials (Parts). Parts A and B purchased contribute to CO₂ emissions from both their
manufacturing (by suppliers) and their transportation to our facilities. These emissions must be
included in the final product’s carbon footprint. Emissions vary by supplier due to differences in
manufacturing technology (more or less polluting) and origin (affecting transport-related emissions).
In our case, emissions are recorded at the moment of purchase, not at assembly or sale. Table VII. 1
shows the estimated emissions per part purchased.
Manufacturing. During production, machines consume electricity, and the company must account
for the CO₂ emissions generated from producing this electricity. The attributable emissions depend
on total energy consumption and the quality of the electricity mix used. Currently, our mix is not very
“green,” producing 0.4 kg CO₂ per kWh consumed. If machines operate below full capacity, energy
use—and thus emissions—are calculated proportionally to utilization.
Product Improvements. Certain product improvements require additional components or
postponement activities that can increase or reduce the product’s carbon footprint compared to the
standard version. Some features will raise CO₂ emissions per unit, others will lower them. Since
postponement occurs at the moment of sale, these emission changes are recorded then. Note: these
emissions are separate from customer perceptions of the product’s environmental friendliness.
Construction of Factories. Building new plant modules generates substantial CO₂ emissions due to
the materials used and energy consumed. Emissions are calculated per module at the time of
construction. In line with good accounting practices, these emissions are distributed evenly over 12
periods to reflect the lifecycle of the asset.
Transportation of Electrocleans. All transportation of finished products will also incur CO
2
emissions. Emissions generated by a shipment are a function of the distance and weight/volume
transported, and the mode of transportation used, airplane being the most polluting mode (e.g., 800 gr
CO /ton/km), followed by truck (e.g., 250 gr CO /ton/km), and then train (e.g., 85 gr CO /ton/km). To
2 2 2
help your analysis, the parameter table below already provides details for each origin-destination and
mode, the estimated kg CO per Electroclean shipped (assuming a given distance for each origin-
2
destination and Electroclean weight). These emissions are recognized at the moment of departure of
the shipment.
Transportation of machines. When machines are transferred between factories, they are transported
by air at the start of the period. Emissions are calculated proportionally to an Electroclean’s emissions
using a “machine correction factor,” provided in Table VII. 1.
5 Note that emissions reported may not completely match your own calculations.

Disposal of Products (due to lack of warehouse capacity). Any Electroclean discarded due to
insufficient warehouse capacity must be transported to a recycling center for disassembly and material
recovery. These activities also generate CO₂ emissions.

Section VII.b: Actions to Reduce/Offset CO
2
Emissions.
Management has four different options to reduce or offset CO emissions and improve the company’s
2
environmental performance. Table VII.2 summarizes the cost and expected impact of each option.
Solar Panels. Solar panels generate clean electricity with zero emissions. This is an investment paid
at the beginning of the period, added to ESG fixed assets, and depreciated over the panels’ lifetime
(see cost and lifespan in Table VII.2). In emissions accounting, the amount of green energy produced
offsets an equivalent amount of CO₂ emissions from “non-green” electricity used by machines,
resulting in a negative adjustment to reported emissions.
Purchase Green Energy. The company can buy a percentage of its electricity needs from an eco-
friendly provider. This increases electricity costs but generates zero emissions for the amount
purchased. The green energy purchased offsets an equivalent amount of CO₂ emissions from “non-
green” electricity consumed by machines.
Tree Planting. Tree planting campaigns can be used to compensate for CO₂ emissions, thereby
reducing net CO₂ emissions. The cost of planting is paid at the beginning of the period, and trees incur
a maintenance cost every fortnight. Table VII.2 provides the CO₂ absorption ratio per tree, along
with planting and maintenance costs.
Purchase CO Credits. The company can purchase carbon credits, each offsetting 1 ton of CO₂.
2
Prices vary depending on the purchase horizon (1, 2, or 3 periods) and the period in which the credits
are acquired.

Section VII.c: Environmental Reporting (Emissions Report)
The simulator provides a complete summary report of your emissions by category and the
corresponding emissions offsets achieved through abatement measures. It also provides three key
summary metrics:
 Emissions Intensity per Period: measured as the total kg CO₂ per unit produced. Your Board
requires this figure to be reduced by at least 15% by the end of each year. For example, if your
Period 6 intensity is 29.93 kg CO₂/unit, emissions should decline progressively in Periods 7, 8,
and 9 so that, by Period 9, intensity is below 25.4 kg CO₂/unit, and below 21.6 kg CO₂/unit by
Period 12.
 ENV KPI (%): the Environmental KPI is a performance score from 0% to 100% assessing your
emissions reduction achievements, as reported by an independent environmental audit firm
(100% corresponds to an A+ rating). The evaluation compares your emissions trajectory with that
of market competitors and against standardized industry targets. The exact algorithm used—
including minimum thresholds, industry percentiles, and weightings—is not disclosed by the
auditor.
 ESG KPI (%): this KPI is a weighted average of the company’s Environmental positioning
(ENV-KPI) and its Social positioning, represented by the Workforce Mood indicator/Productivity
factor resulting from labor relations decisions. This KPI evaluates each company from an ESG
perspective and compares its performance with that of other companies in the same environment.
The ESG KPI ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) and reflects the company’s standing relative to
the market average.
Chapter VIII. Finance
The company’s Finance Department is responsible for: (a) monitoring financial performance, (b)
overseeing expenditures and investments, and (c) ensuring both short-term and long-term liquidity
(i.e., maintaining sufficient cash for operations and planned investments). In collaboration with the
CEO, it is also responsible for defining a coherent balance between debt and equity. The company’s
financial situation at the end of Period 6 is presented in Chapter IX.
Section VIII.a: Financial instruments
The company has access to various short-term and long-term financing options, which may evolve
over time as market conditions and company performance change. Limits, interest rates, and other
terms may be adjusted as the simulation progresses. Table VIII. 1 provides a complete description
of the available options, interest rates, and limits for this version of the case.
Short-term financing:
 Short-term line of credit. An unsecured facility provided by the company’s local bank, available
on a fortnight-by-fortnight basis up to a limit established at the beginning of each period. Interest
rates and limits may change from one period to another as banks update their terms. Table VIII.
1 details the prevailing conditions.
In any period, the maximum total amount available under the line of credit is capped at a given
percentage of the company’s net fixed assets, as measured at the end of the previous period. This
limit may eventually be indexed to other parameters, depending on the terms set by the bank (see
30

--- Page 31 (pdfplumber) ---
*** Text ***
IESE / IPADE October 2025 review
Table VIII. 1 for the current limit). For example, with net fixed assets totaling $697,625 at the
end of Period 6, the credit line limit for Period 7 is $230,216. Given that the starting balance for
Period 7 is $113,000, the company can still draw up to an additional $117,216 during Period 7.
Interest on the outstanding balance is accrued fortnightly, based on the closing balance of each
fortnight (see Table VIII. 1 for exact rates and limits).
 Short-term deposits. Cash surpluses can be invested in short-term deposit accounts to earn
interest income. Deposits can be adjusted fortnightly, allowing funds to be added or withdrawn
as needed. Interest is calculated on the deposit balance at the end of each fortnight and credited
to the company on a fortnightly basis. Applicable interest rates are shown in Table VIII. 1.
 Other products. Other short-term financing alternatives may become available during the
simulation and will be discussed with the instructor or the participating bank.
Long-term financing:
 Mortgages. The bank offers mortgages to finance long-term investments such as plant modules,
machinery, product improvements, solar panels or tree planting campaigns. As of the end of
Period 6, the company already has active mortgages with a defined repayment schedule (see
Table VIII. 1 for details).
New mortgages must be negotiated and approved by the bank individually at the beginning of
each period. The process for setting interest rates and repayment terms may vary and will be
clarified at the start of the simulation. Interest is calculated on the total mortgage balance at the
beginning of the period and is payable at the start of the following period. For example, if the
mortgage balance is increased by $100,000 to a total of $600,000 at the beginning of a period,
and the interest rate is 6%, the company will accrue interest expenses of $36,000, payable at the
beginning of the next period. Interest accrued in the prior period must also be paid at the
beginning of the current period.
Emergency loan. The company must maintain a positive cash position (a) at the beginning of each
period after accounting for all initial payments (i.e., in the initial cash flow) and (b) after each
subsequent fortnight (i.e., in the subperiod cash flows; see Section VIII.b). If the cash position
becomes negative at any of these points, the company will automatically receive an emergency loan
to cover the shortfall, preventing a temporary default on payments.
The emergency loan is issued for the exact amount required to cover the deficit and carries a
significantly high interest rate (e.g., 30% per four-month period). Emergency loans taken during the
period accumulate and remain outstanding until the period ends, even if multiple loans are issued in
different fortnights. Interest accrues for the remainder of the period, regardless of whether the
company’s cash position later improves. Repayment does not occur within the same period; instead,
at the start of the next period, accrued interest is paid first, followed by repayment of the principal
during the first fortnight.
The emergency loan is strictly a last-resort mechanism of the game and must not be used intentionally
as a regular financing tool. Deliberate reliance on this facility is considered equivalent to a de facto
bankruptcy if the amounts are substantial, and is prohibited. Such misuse would reflect extremely
poorly on the Chief Financial Officer and the management team.
Additional financing instruments may, over the course of the simulation, be requested by companies
or made available by the bank or other stakeholders.

Section VIII.b: Cashflows Management and Schedule
The company must manage a detailed schedule of receipts (cash inflows) and payments (cash
outflows) to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained at all times during the period. To achieve this, it
is essential to distinguish between initial cash flows and subperiod (fortnight) cash flows.
Initial cash flow. These occur at the very beginning of the period, before any operations have
commenced. They are typically associated with long-term decisions (e.g., plant and equipment
purchases, product improvements, mortgages), operational decisions fixed for the duration of the
period (e.g., hiring of sales force, warehouse rentals, payments for parts), or obligations carried over
from previous periods (e.g., taxes, interest, and other payables).
Subperiod (fortnight) cash flow”. These occur fortnightly during the operational phase of the
period. They are linked either to decisions executed in specific fortnights (e.g., parts purchases,
shipments, use of short-term lines of credit) or to recurring payments (e.g., salaries, energy costs).
To assist the Finance Department in maintaining visibility over payment schedules, a detailed list of
receipts and payments is provided in Table VIII. 2.
